This flight system operates similarly to more popular flight reservations services such as Kayak, Expedia, and etc.
Flight infomation is stored on a virtual machine based on WPI campus, and this system allows users to simulate purchasing a plane trip from one airport to another (within the US). 

# Dependencies:

- Java 1.6 or higher is needed to use this system
- You need to download the gs-core-1.2.jar and gs-algo-1.2.jar files and place them within the <code>lib</code> folder in order to run

The jar files are available from http://graphstream-project.org/download/
